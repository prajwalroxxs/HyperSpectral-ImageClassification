# 🧠 Hyper Spectral Image Classification

**HyperSpectral-ImageClassification** offers an end-to-end workflow for working with hyperspectral datasets.  

- Includes Jupyter notebooks and modular scripts for **preprocessing**, **training**, and **evaluation**  
- Simple to reproduce results or extend with new models  
- Train classifiers, visualize predictions, and analyze results  
- Organized structure to manage datasets and outputs efficiently
